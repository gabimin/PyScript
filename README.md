# PyScript-testing

PyScript-testing is a project demonstrating the use of PyScript for running Python code directly in the browser. This example showcases how to integrate popular Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib to perform data analysis and visualization tasks on the web.

PyScript is a framework that allows users to write Python code that runs directly in the web browser. It combines the capabilities of Python with the interactivity of web technologies, enabling developers to build and deploy Python applications with HTML. 

For more detailed information, you can explore the official documentation or resources related to PyScript.


## Features

- **NumPy Integration**: Utilize NumPy for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib Integration**: Create and display plots directly in the browser.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate interactive histograms and other plots.
